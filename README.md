## Web Development Homework - first part

### Homework description
    I organized the homework in more files, with suggestive names, 
    that I will desribe further. In htmlFiles I put all the files 
    written in html, in cssFiles all the files writen in css that 
    correspond to the html ones and in jsFiles all the files in javascript 
    corresponding to html pages. Besides these folders I have a folder with 
    the icons I used for the navbar (icons folder) and a folder with images 
    used for the game (imgs). I also used the university logo for which I 
    have not created a separate folder.

    I did all the 6 pages required with the specified functionalities.

    Sometimes, the alerts I created do have some bugs when there is 
    needed to press the "ok" button more time as I tried to mention 
    in the comments in javascript.

### Additional comments on the homework
    I think I could have done the homework better, but I 
    will come back to it because I found as a really good way 
    to practice what I learned from the course. I have to mention 
    that I started from 0 with html, css and javascript and this was my 
    first time writing code in the 3 of them. I found it as a very pleasant 
    way to learn and practice. I really liked all the indications given 
    and I found them very useful. I think it is going to be a great 
    project to add in the CV.
